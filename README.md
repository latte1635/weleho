# weleho

This is just a school project I worked on with a friend. I wrote most of the code that is visible during the cave areas.

Yes, the code is super messy, I now... This project was done while we were learning the basics of OOP.

The master branch was done earlier, the "optimized" branch is for rewriting most of the bad code.
